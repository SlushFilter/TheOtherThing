For menu background:
	- Currently background is composed of multiple "child" Crafty entities, each of which holds a sprite for a portion of the background.

		- Then direct the DOM backgroundImage to the canvas:
			entity._element.style.backgroundImage = "url(" + canvasName.toDataURL("image/png") + ")"
